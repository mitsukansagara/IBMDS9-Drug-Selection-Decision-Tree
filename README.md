# Personalized-Drug-Prescription-Model     


Used Decision Trees as the classification algorithm to build a model from the historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Used this trained decision tree to predict the class of an unknown patient, and to find a proper drug for a new patient.


• Utilized a comprehensive healthcare dataset of patients with a specific illness    
• Implemented the Decision Tree algorithm to analyze patient demographic information and medical data     
• Developed a personalized drug prescription system with a 98% accuracy rate      
• Surpassed traditional methods, optimizing treatment plans and minimizing potential adverse reactions through data-driven decision-making     
• Demonstrated the significant impact of data analysis in the healthcare sector
